Open each project in the JME3 SDK http://jmonkeyengine.org/

the Experiments are clients and need the server to run first:

run the server, then run the client as many times as you would like to see drop into game at once  to a max of 10: i haven't added dynamic growth of
char max limit yet. Currently I do not recommend doing this on a laptop, they do not have the power to handle it.

Enjoy
